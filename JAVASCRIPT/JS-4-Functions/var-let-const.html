    <!-- JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). -->
    <!-- When to Use JavaScript const?
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

These are constant values and cannot be changed.

The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

This is a value that can be changed.-->
