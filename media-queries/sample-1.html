    <!--What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript. 
        A media query is an HTML/CSS functionality that allows the content of a Web page 
        to adapt to the type of media that the page is being rendered in, 
        such as a computer screen or that of a phone or tablet. -->
        <!-- Definition and Usage
The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet
 (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. -->
