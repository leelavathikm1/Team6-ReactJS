    <!-- What are Pseudo-classes?
    A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

    Style an element when a user mouses over it
    Style visited and unvisited links differently
    Style an element when it gets focus -->

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
