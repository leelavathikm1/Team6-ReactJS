    <!-- Positions
	The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
	There are five different positions

	1.static
	2.relative
	3.fixed
	4.absolute
	5.sticky

	Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 
	However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
	They also work differently depending on the position value.

 	-->
	 <!--1. position: static
		is not positioned in any special way; 
		it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page 

	div.static {
  	position: static;
  	border: 3px solid red;
	}
	-->
	<!-- 2. position: relative 
		is positioned relative to its normal position
		Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element
	 	will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 
		Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.	 

	div.relative {
  	position: relative;
  	left: 10px;
  	border: 3px solid ;
	}
	-->
	<!-- position: fixed  is positioned relative to the viewport, 
		 which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
		 The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

		A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. 
		
		div.fixed {
  		position: fixed;
  		bottom: 0;
  		right: 0;
  		width: 400px;
  		border: 3px solid blue;
	}
	-->

	<!-- position: absolute  is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
		(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

		if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
		it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. 
	
		div.relative {
  		position: relative;
  		width: 400px;
  		height: 200px;
  		border: 3px solid #73AD21;
		}

		div.absolute {
  		position: absolute;
  		top: 80px;
  		right: 0;
  		width: 200px;
  		height: 100px;
  		border: 3px solid #73AD21;
		}
	-->

	<!-- position: sticky is positioned based on the user's scroll position
		A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
		It is positioned relative until a given offset position 
		is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed)
		
		div.sticky {
  		position: sticky;
  		top: 0;
  		background-color: green;
  		border: 2px solid #4CAF50;
		}
